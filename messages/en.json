        "faq_q1": "Do your peptides contain fillers or additives?",
        "faq_a1": "No. Our products contain pure active compounds only, with composition independently verified. No fillers, no binders, no undeclared ingredients. What's on the label is exactly what's in the vial.",
        "faq_q2": "Do you ship to my country?",
        "faq_a2": "We ship to all EU countries and select international destinations. All shipments include tracking, proper documentation, and customs-compliant labeling. Shipments originate from within the EU, eliminating customs risks for European researchers.",
        "faq_q3": "Why do you accept only cryptocurrency?",
        "faq_a3": "Cryptocurrency payments provide maximum privacy and security for both parties. No personal financial data is stored or transmitted. Transactions are confirmed on the blockchain within minutes, eliminating chargeback fraud and keeping prices competitive.",
        "faq_q4": "How long does crypto payment confirmation take?",
        "faq_a4": "Confirmation times vary by network: Bitcoin typically takes 15-60 minutes, while stablecoins (USDC/USDT) and other chains confirm within seconds. Your order moves to 'Processing' automatically once payment is confirmed. If your order hasn't updated within 2 hours, contact our support.",
        "faq_q5": "Can I cancel my order?",
        "faq_a5": "You may request a cancellation as long as your order has not been shipped yet. Once a package has been dispatched, cancellation is no longer possible — but our Buyer Protection policy covers any delivery issues.",
        "faq_q6": "What purity level do I need for my research?",
        "faq_a6": "Research applications typically require 95-99%+ purity for reliable results. Lower purity can introduce variables that compromise data integrity. All our products meet the ≥99% standard, suitable for pharmaceutical-grade research protocols.",
        "faq_q7": "Do you offer returns or exchanges?",
        "faq_a7": "Due to the temperature-sensitive nature of research compounds, we do not accept returns. This policy exists to protect all customers — we guarantee that no previously shipped product is ever resold. If you receive a damaged or incorrect product, our Buyer Protection policy covers you fully.",
        "faq_q8": "Are research peptides legal to purchase?",
        "faq_a8": "Research peptides sold for laboratory use are legal to purchase in most jurisdictions when clearly labeled 'For Research Purposes Only.' Our products are not approved for human consumption. Regulations vary by location — verify your local requirements before ordering.",
        "faq_q9": "Why do products say 'not for human consumption'?",
        "faq_a9": "This disclaimer indicates our peptides are research-grade compounds intended for in-vitro laboratory applications. They have not been evaluated by regulatory authorities (FDA, EMA) for human safety or efficacy. We maintain strict regulatory compliance in all our operations.",
