    "faq_a1": "No. Our products contain pure active compounds only, with composition independently verified. No fillers, no binders, no undeclared ingredients. What's on the label is exactly what's in the vial.",
    "faq_q2": "Do you ship to my country?",
    "faq_a2": "We ship to all EU countries and select international destinations. All shipments include tracking, proper documentation, and customs-compliant labeling. Shipments originate from within the EU, eliminating customs risks for European researchers.",
    "faq_q3": "How do you guarantee my privacy?",
    "faq_a3": "Your security is paramount. All orders pass through offline encrypted gateways. We utilize stealth packaging with no external references to the contents.",
    "faq_q4": "What are the processing times?",
    "faq_a4": "Orders confirmed before 12:00 PM (CET) are processed and shipped the same business day. You will receive a secure tracking email as soon as the package leaves logistics.",

    "faq_q6": "What purity level do I need for my research?",
    "faq_a6": "Research applications typically require 95-99%+ purity for reliable results. Lower purity can introduce variables that compromise data integrity. All our products meet the ≥99% standard, suitable for pharmaceutical-grade research protocols.",
    "faq_q7": "Do you offer returns or exchanges?",
    "faq_a7": "Due to the temperature-sensitive nature of research compounds, we do not accept returns. This policy exists to protect all customers — we guarantee that no previously shipped product is ever resold. If you receive a damaged or incorrect product, our Buyer Protection policy covers you fully.",
    "faq_q8": "Are research peptides legal to purchase?",
    "faq_a8": "Research peptides sold for laboratory use are legal to purchase in most jurisdictions when clearly labeled 'For Research Purposes Only.' Our products are not approved for human consumption. Regulations vary by location — verify your local requirements before ordering.",
    "faq_q9": "Why do products say 'not for human consumption'?",
