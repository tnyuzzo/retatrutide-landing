# Aura Peptides UI/UX Audit & Implementation Notes

The UI/UX and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) audit for the Aura Peptides Retatrutide landing page has been completed.

## Key Improvements Implemented:
1. **Hero Section Redesign**: Added a radial gold glow for depth and a dynamic bulk discount price calculator.
2. **Crypto Payment Modal**: Added a "New to Crypto?" guide to reduce payment friction.
3. **Infinite Trust Ticker**: Replaced static trust badges with a fluid infinite scrolling marquee.
4. **Interactive Lab Report Dialog**: Transformed the static PDF link into an immersive in-page modal displaying Janoshik's HPLC purity results.
5. **Micro-interactions**: Deployed Framer Motion `whileInView` reveal animations and global CSS `shimmer` effects to achieve a high-end biotech aesthetic.

All changes have been visually verified using a browser sub-agent and documented in the project's brain artifacts.
